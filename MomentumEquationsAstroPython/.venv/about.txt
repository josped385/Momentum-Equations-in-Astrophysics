About

This app has been developed by a student of the University of Seville, as a fun project. After studying Astrophysics, I needed to learn how to create GUIs for bigger and more complex projects (CurveTracer, in other repository here in GitHub), so I decided to create this "more simple" app in order to practice.

There was an exercise involving momentum equations in Astrophysics, in which we needed to simplify equations in order to make them more simple for pencil and paper solutions. I was curious to see by how much did the solution differ from the "exact" solution (involving more parameters), so I decided to program an app to do it. The MATLAB App is slightly more abandoned, but it should work just fine.
