Overview

This application visualizes the trajectory of a particle in 3D space under the influence of Coriolis and curvature terms derived from the momentum equations. It excludes the effects of pressure gradient and frictional forces for simplicity. The equations account for zonal (u), meridional (v), and vertical (w) components of velocity.

Limitations

- The application does not include atmospheric pressure gradient (P) or frictional forces (F).
- Assumes a spherical planet with constant radius.
- Assume gravitational parameter g is constant.

Using the application

In order to run the app, the user has to specify the initial conditions for the coordinates u,v and w, as well as x, y and z (cartesian coordinates). The user has to provide the radius (a) and the radial velocity (Omega) of the planet and the latitude (phi) of the object in the planet. Then, the user has to press the button (Represent trajectory) and the trajectory of the body will be represented in the axes of the figure.

In order to simplify the proceeding, some common planets are displayed (Solar System planets) with Omegas and a already defined, so if the user wants to use any of those planets as a reference, the data is already there.

There is also a Hold on check box, so the user can represent multiple graphs in the same figure, for comparison and analyses.

A reset button is also provided to withdraw all the graphs in the figure.

If the user right-clicks the phi field, the user can have access to a calculator that converts degrees into radians, and viceversa, useful characteristic for phi calculations. Thos option can be accesed through the "File" menu.

Some functionalities are available when right-cliking the graph:

- Save as: the user can save the plot in various formats.
- Export to Workspace: the user can export the curve data to the Workspace.
- Rename curve: the user can rename any curve.
- Hide curve: the user can hide any curve.
- Show curve: if a curve has been hidden, the user can show it again on the graph.
- Load Data: the user can input any data on the graph. The data must be in .mat.
